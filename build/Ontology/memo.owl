<!-- 
Planned Classes 

knowyourmeme.com has more than just memes... 
There are:
Cultures
Events
Memes
People
Sites
Subcultures

The URL structure is always: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/abc/xyz
Where:
abc is one of the categories
xyz is a specific instance of said category

As such, I plan on creating classes for each of these categories.
The data population will be exactly the same, but there will be some parent class: Category (will have to resolve name with the Category class already here).

  <textRepresentation>ew Bring Back National Dex refers to the backlash following the announcement that the 2019 video games Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield will not include the full roster of Pokmon from previous games and only include Pokmon that appear in the Galar Pokdex This is the first game in the series that will not allow for some Pokmon from previous generations of Pokmon titles The backlash also occurred within the Japanese arm of the fandom where it spread on Twitter and Pixiv under the hashtag  compatibility cut Background On June 11th 2019 during the Nintendo Treehouse showcase at Nintendos E3 event there was a showcase for the Pokmon Sword and Shield on the game floor During the end of the showcase Pokmon director Junichi Masuda announced in advance that in Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield players will only be able to transfer Pokmon from the Pokmon Home app if they appear within the Galar region Pokdex thereby removing the possibility for certain monsters to be playable at all The reason for this move has been attributed to a number of issues such as efforts to balance the games roster and reducing the number of character models within the game data to make for higher quality animations Masuda also appeared to state that this would be the policy for all future games in the series4 Speaking to USGamer5 Masuda said We knew at some point we werent going to be able to indefinitely keep supporting all of the Pokemon We just found that Sword and Shield would probably be a good point to go back and reevaluate what would be the best selection of Pokemon that appeal to the widest audience while keeping into consideration the balance of the battle system It isnt just going to be allnew Pokemon in the Galar region Pokedex theres still going to be a lot of favorites that fans will be able to bring over that theyve adventured with previously But yeah it was pretty much just balancing and getting this optimal selection of Pokemon for the adventure we wanted to provide Developments Following the announcement fans were quick to voice their disapproval for not being able to transfer their Pokmon to the latest entries Twitter users started the BringBackNationalDex hashtag amounting over seven thousands tweets in a day1 Part of the disapproval stemmed from doubt in Masudas explanation for why the Pokmon were cut Twitter user shofu tweeted a sarcastic example of the games animation being high quality gaining over 5900 retweets and 21000 likes shown below User ExoExplorer tweeted a similar joke gaining over 1200 retweets and 3000 likes shown below right Junichi Masuda reaffirms that the sheer volume of high quality animations and desire to balance further resulted in the decision to block transfer of some Pokmon This is some high quality animation alright pictwittercomgwXJCrXLqD Garbage shofu June 12 2019 Yeah I just found this clip The animation on those wingull is really something I feel completely comforted knowing we had to sacrifice the national dex for this step up in quality BringBackNationalDex PokemonE3 pictwittercomd4tGVdBnbG ExoExplorer ExoExplorer June 12 2019 Others created memes decrying the change Twitter user extendedfreeze2 tweeted an object labeling meme about the change gaining over 280 retweets and 740 likes shown below left User Roeltje6663 also posted an object labeling meme about the change gaining 7 retweets and 30 likes shown below right The controversy was covered by multiple gaming outlets including Polygon who defended the decision against criticism3 writing Many miffed players are calling Game Freak lazy for not bringing the entire compendium of 800 monsters into Sword and Shield which is a wild thing to say The problem isnt laziness The problem if you can call it that is a difference in priorities If Game Freak thought it was important to have the entire Pokdex available in the Galar region it would do exactly that Instead the developer seems to be putting its focus on other portions of the game We know that Sword and Shield will have raids an open world extended online capabilities and a 3D camera all in addition to improved graphics Gamesradar4 also covered the criticism understanding that while it would surely be difficult to model 800 Pokmon into future Pokmon titles If your favourite Pokemon isnt chosen for Sword and Shield well tough luck Theres seemingly very little we can do about it If you dont get lucky with the next games Pokemon Catapult and Trebuchet anyone either your Pokemon will simply be stuck in Pokemon Home limbo unable to progress any further Masudas Message On June 28th 2019 the official Pokmon twitter made an announcement a message for Pokmon video game fans The link sent users to the official Pokmon page with a statement from Junichi Masuda Thank you to all of our fans for caring so deeply about Pokmon Recently I shared the news that some Pokmon cannot be transferred to Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield Ive read all your comments and appreciate your love and passion for Pokmon Just like all of you we are passionate about Pokmon and each and every one of them is very important to us After so many years of developing the Pokmon video games this was a very difficult decision for me Id like to make one thing clear even if a specific Pokmon is not available in Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield that does not mean it will not appear in future games The world of Pokmon continues to evolve The Galar region offers new Pokmon to encounter Trainers to battle and adventures to embark on We are pouring our hearts into these games and we hope you will look forward to joining us on this new journey June 28 2019 Junichi Masuda After the message fans were quick to call out the statement for the lack of any promises for the newer entries in the series who were hoping for future patches While other were angered that Masuda made a response to the backlash Search Interest Know Your Meme Store External

Pokmon Mystery Dungeon Rescue Team DX a Switch remake of the 2006 Pokmon Mystery Dungeon Rescue Team games and expansion packs for Pokmon Sword and Shield titled The Isle of Armor and The Crown Tundra The expansion passes will expand to new areas outside the Galar region and players will be able to enter the areas using their current save file Both areas will have areas that operate similar to the Wild Area in the base game In the Direct Game Freak clarified that these expansions will take the place of the traditional altered versions of the base game like Pokmon Platinum Pokmon Ultra Sun and Moon and Pokmon Black and White 2 The Direct also teased that both old and new legendary Pokmon would be available in the expansions as would several preexisting Pokmon that were not present in the base game such as Garchomp Blastoise Venusaur and many others The Direct stated that there will be roughly 200 old Pokmon in total entering the game through the Expansion Pass14 Certain Pokmon and

2020 and The Crown Tundra will release in Fall of 2020 They are available for prepurchase for 2999 Reception The game received intense backlash prior to its release due to what fans perceived as poor quality in leaked footage and data about the game These issues largely stemmed from the cutting of 400 Pokmon from the National Pokdex making Sword and Shield the first games in the series to not include every Pokmon in the series history Game Freak had stated that they had made this choice in order to create higher quality animations for the existing Pokmon in the game When footage of the game leaked however fans did not accept Game Freaks excuse claiming that the animations were not significantly improved enough from previous titles to justify the cut Pokmon Several moves that had appeared in previous games were also cut from the games including moves popular in the competitive Pokmon scene like Return and Frustration These frustrations were covered in hashtags BringBackNationalDex and GameFreakLied Critical Reception Though fans had generated significant backlash to the games prior to their release critics were mostly positive about Sword and Shield On the day of the games release the games Metacritic score was 81 or generally favorable11 Some critics called them the best Pokmon games in years Gamespot12 wrote the game cut down on the tedious and protracted elements from previous games in favor of amplifying what makes Pokemon great in the first place In the least positive review included in Metacritics score the Daily Star gave the game a 3513 writing that Dynamaxing was a shallow imitation of past games features and that the Wild Area the games new wildPokmon feature was akin to a levelgated Safari Zone Critic Dom Peppiatt concluded that the game could be thought of as a goodnotgreat Pokmon game Online Presence BringBackNationalDex Bring Back National Dex refers to the backlash towards the reveal that Pokmon Sword and Shield will not allow players to transfer Pokmon absent from the Galar Regional Pokdex breaking the seriess tradition of having all Pokmon from past generations usable in one title even if they are not able to be caught ingame Following this restrictions reveal at Nintendo Treehouses E3 2019 presentation fans voiced their displeasure towards it over various social media outlets and the aforementioned presentation became the most disliked video of E3 201910 ThankYouGameFreak ThankYouGameFreak is a hashtag started by a Pokmon fan intended to celebrate and appreciate Pokmon developers Game Freak amid ongoing criticisms and controversy for the asyet unreleased Pokmon Sword and Shield Many fans used the hashtag as intended while others used it more sarcastically to further criticize Game Freak A

of spineless cowards who would rather lick your boot than have any form of self respect GameFreakLied GameFreakLied is a hashtag used to complain about Pokmon Sword and Shield after an apparent datamine of the asyetunreleased games appeared to confirm that Pokmon developers Game Freak had reused character models and animations from previous entries in the series The company had previously taken the position that it was forced to cut a significant amount of Pokmon because it was remaking animations and character models from scratch The decision colloquially known as Dexit was unpopular with fans and upon seeing that Game Freaks excuse did not seem legitimate fans tweeted angrily about the upcoming games using leaked footage On November 12th 2019 Redditor MindWeb125 posted a thread in rpokemon showing allegedly leaked datamined comparisons of several Sword and Shield Pokmon models and the same Pokmon models from the previous games Pokmon Sun and Moon This was significant as Game Freaks Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori had previously stated that the reason many Pokmon from previous entries were cut in Sword and Shield was so the team could focus on remaking Pokmon from scratch Meanwhile the leaks were posted to Twitter by user BlazingFlare two posted GIFs comparing models gaining over 160 retweets and 440 likes shown below Ive been going through the returning

reads Ok guys i feel like we need to formulate a game plan Ive put together this easy to follow diagram here for a proposed plan The basic idea is that the Kyles form the front line if we feed them enough psilocybin and monster energy and say that anyone in camouflage is their step dad and the entire base is made of drywall then they will go berserk and become an impenetrable wall Then the Rock Throwers will throw pebbles at the inevitable resistance we dont want to hurt them we just want to annoy them enough to not shoot the Kyles as often While this is all happening the two Naruto runner battalions will run full speed around the north and south flank and shadow clone jutsu effectively tripling our numbers and overwhelm the base red circle PS Hello US government this is a joke and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet Im not responsible if people decide to actually storm area 51 During the

  <textRepresentation>ew Etika Suicide refers to the death161718 of famous YouTuber Desmond Amofah otherwise known as Etika After months of making posts which alarmed onlookers about his mental health he posted a video on June 20th 2019 which saw him walking in New York City and apologizing to multiple people hes harmed or wronged and saying he would not live to see the release of games and media To viewers the video seemed like a suicide note Concerns were further raised when the NYPD tweeted looking for tips in finding Etika1 who had not been heard from since 800 PM the day before the video was uploaded Local news also ran reports about his disappearance1920 The NYPD confirmed that he was dead on June 25th 201913 Background Etika has scared fans about his mental health by alluding to suicide and and giving megalomaniacal statements since October of 2018 Over the course of the following several months he had several incidents where he tweeted about killing himself and at one point livestreamed the police arriving at his house and arresting him for his safety The following day he compared himself to the Antichrist in an interview with Keemstar On May 1st 2019 he was filmed fighting an NYPD officer On June 19th 2019 Etika posted a video to YouTube apologizing to his fans saying he was sorry for betraying their trust and pushing them away He stated he was not suicidal in previous incidents saying in an attempt to be edgy I fucked up my entire life It also featured Etika talking as though he would not be alive for much longer saying things like there will be games movies technology Ill never see Ill never see Attack on Titan He also said the world will be better off without me To many it appeared like a suicide note The video was deleted from YouTube reupload shown below Developments Initially people were divided on the legitimacy of Etikas condition as some of his previous scares had been considered hoaxes or him being edgy which he alludes to in the video This was compounded by the fact that on June 2nd Etika tweeted asking When should I have my next mental breakdown yall what days yall niggas got off  User absolutemystic suggested June 20th as most people will be out of school to which Etika replied Ill put this on my calendar shown below This led some like Keemstar to believe Etikas June 19th video was staged and insincere Others including 3andrewsinarow argued that the exchange could be interpreted as Etika secretly asking his fans for a date on which to kill himself and then receiving one On June 20th the NYPD posted a tweet saying Etika was missing and asking for tips1 The tweet gained over 23000 retweets and 36000 likes shown below Fox New York ran a news story about his disappearance2 as did more global publications like
